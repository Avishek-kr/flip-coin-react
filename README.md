# React State Exercises
This exercise gives you some practice working with props, defaultProps, state, and simple click events in React.

You’ll also get more experience setting state and binding event handlers. Really important stuff!

For each exercise: make a new React project with create-react-app.

## Part 1: Coin Flip
For this part, create a coin flipping counter.

The user should be able to click on a button to flip a coin. Every time the user clicks, the coin gets flipped again. The app should also keep track of how many times heads and tails have shown up.

Before building anything, think about the structure of your React app. Don’t build this application with a single component: think about how to break your app up into at least two separate components!

Here’s some inspiration:

If you’d like, get creative and come up with your own coin faces! If you want to use the same coin as I did, you can find the images here:
